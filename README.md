# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**1. Overview of the analysis**

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. To accomplish this task, the following deliverables will be carried out:
*   Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
*   Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
*   Deliverable 3: A written report based on the employee datbase analysis (READ.md)


**2. Results**

*   Breakdown of eligible employee retirement analysis: 
    *    32,452 Staff
    *    29,415 Senior Engineer
    *    14,221 Engineer
    *    8,047 Senior Staff
    *    4,502 Technique Leader
    *    1,761 Assistant Engineer
    *    Total: 90,398 employees that are able to retire in the near future

**3. Summary**

There appears to be a "silver tsunami" on the horizon for Bobby and his manager.  
*   As stated above, there are 90,398 total roles that will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami: begins to make an impact. This means almost a hundred thousand employees, a very good percentage of the entire staff could start retiring at any given time. 
*   Another issue for Bobby and his manager is that there are only 1,940 employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This means only about 2 percent of all positions have staff within the company that may be able to fill the position.
