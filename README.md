# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

**1. Overview of the analysis**

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age. To accomplish this task, the following deliverables will be carried out:
*   Deliverable 1: The Number of Retiring Employees by Title
*   Deliverable 2: The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program
*   Deliverable 3: A written report based on the employee datbase analysis (READ.md)
